# SDH-DiscordChats
DiscordChats is a plugin for the Steam Deck, to use the discord chats of a specific server. You will be able to write in all channels and to all members of the server, and also shows the status of each member. This is possible because it uses the [discord api](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html) to create a bot which will be the user that will be used to perform all actions.


## Installation



## Bot configuration

## Token configuration

The token associated with the previously created bot is required for the plugin to work. You can obtain this token by accessing [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications), select the `steamdeckchatbot` application, go to the Bot option in the Settings menu. An option called `Reset Token` will appear which will reset the token and display it on the screen. Copy the token and save it to the following path on the steam deck file system
`/home/deck/homebrew/services/token.txt`
